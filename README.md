- Exercise 1: Write a Python code snippet using IPython.display to embed the Wikileaks google sheet directly into a Jupyter notebook
- Exercise 2: Save the csv file to your computer and extract the column names into a dictionary.
- Exercise 3: Plot a historgram, kernel density plot, and a bar chart (vertical and horizontal)
- Exercise 4: Write a loop that iterates through each row of a DataFrame and prints the value of one specific column.
- Exercise 5: create a list containing the "Civilians" and "Afghan forces". Obtain a monthly total count of casualties for both groups and create a line and bar plot.

- Exercise 1: load the goodreads.csv data and change the column names.
- Exercise 2: subset the data by creating a new dataframe with select columns.
- Exercise 3: manage the missing data by counting # of missing values, dropping rows, excluding variables, replacing variables, or predicting missing data.
- Exercise 4: parse the author_url to create a new column named author
- Exercise 5: save the cleaned dataframe
- Exercise 6: investigate the relationship between the umber of reviews and the average rating for books in the dataset. Correlation coefficient, Pearson coefficient, scatter plot. 
- Exercise 7: Calculate: mean, median, standard deviation, range, histogram, box plot.

- Exercise 1: Build a Queen contiguity-based spatial weight matrix
- Exercise 2: Calculate Moran's I and the P-Value
- Exercise 3: Standardizing Spatial Matrices (the weight of each row sums to 1)
- Exercise 4: Distance based weights
- Exercise 5: Visualize a Moran Plot

- Data: Boston housing prices
- Step 1: Load in the data (tab-delimited)
- Step 2: use a previous function to automatically partition the data into a training and validation set.
- Step 3: create a multivariate regression model to explain the median value of owner-occupied homes.
- Step 4: Interpret the magnitude of each coefficient, the sign and the significance level.
- Step 5: Create another regression by including two more variables OR remove two variables.
